# inkscape

There are two types of images: bitmap image and vector image. See this to get the idea of differences between
them: https://www.lifewire.com/vector-and-bitmap-images-1701238

* Photoshop for bitmap images (e.g. gel pictures)
* Illustrator for vector images (e.g. plots from python/R in pdf format)

I use free tools: 
* [gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) for bigmap images.
* [inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) for vector images.
